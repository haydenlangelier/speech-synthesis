To catch them is my real test, to train them is my cause...
I will travel across the land, searching far and wide,
Teach Pokemon to understand, the power that's inside.
Pokemon...gotta catch 'em all!!
It's you and me...
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon...Oh..you're my best friend,
in a world we must defend.
Pokemon...Gotta catch 'em all!!
A heart so true--Our courage will pull us through!
You teach me and I'll teach you! 
Pokemon! 
Gotta Catch 'Em All!
Gotta Catch 'Em All!
POKE-KE-MON!"
